# Territorial
The Chaotic Neutral mod that adds:
- Omniscient blocks that actively want to harm you which can be harnessed to harm others
- Locks that can be used to protect your stuff but can also be bypassed in unique ways
- Special items that are crafted in unique ways and can be utalized to cause absolute chaos
  
And plenty of other random stuff I thought would be fun to add like **LASERS**. Who doesn't love lasers right.
Pretty much everything in the mod is configurable and can be adjusted for balance. In-built cheat detection is also included for certain aspects of the mod.
